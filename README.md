## Functionality

To syncronise videos between multiple clients a simple websocket client and server (relay) is used. A very simple bookmarklet injects the socket client into the streaming site. Each client generates a a random uuid that is used as a session identifier. The client that registers first with a new session id will run in operator mode. Every media control (play/pause/scrub) is pushed to the server and relayed to all other clients that registered for the same session id.
